      <p class="aboutme-text">I was born in 1991 in Hungary, in a
          northwestern town. Currently, I work as an officer in the army,
          but I would like to change carrier paths very soon. I always like
          to learn and try out new things. My
          main
          interests and hobbies are the following:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby">
      <h3 class="hobby-title-left">🏋️ Workout</h3>
      <p class="hobby-text">I really enjoy a lot of workout types. These
          include long-distance running, gym workouts mixing body-building
          and powerlifting, bodyweight training, kettlebell workouts, and
          occasionaly swimming and rowing. My biggest feat is running a
          marathon three times in my life, with my best time being 3 hours and
          17 minutes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby">
      <h3 class="hobby-title-right">Reading 📚</h3>
      <p class="hobby-text">Though I don't read as much as I used to, I
          still really like the works of H. P. Lovecraft. I am a fan of
      the Cthulhu mythos. I also love reading books about sociology,
          psychology, history and science. One of my favourites is A Brief
          History of Time by Stephen Hawking.

  <div class="hobby">
      <h3 class="hobby-title-left">🎧 Music</h3>
      <p class="hobby-text">Music has always been a huge part of my life. I
          mainly used to listen to Metal in my teenage years, my favourite
          band being Rammstein, a band based in Germany. I also was a huge
          fan of Slipknot, Static-X and Mudvayne. Nowadays, I am a lot less
          picky and really enjoy Phonk recently.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby">
      <h3 class="hobby-title-right">Computers 👨‍💻</h3>
      <p class="hobby-text">I have been a huge geek since my childhood. I
          rarely spent time outside. Instead, I was always preoccupied in
          front of a screen. I used to play a lot of video games. My most
          played game is probably TES IV Oblivion, or World of Warcraft, but
      I also spent a lot of time in front of the Need for Speed games, other
      RPGs, the GTA series and the Sims series. Apart from gaming, I have
          always entertained the idea of becoming a programmer or a web
          designer some day. In fact, the sole purpose of this website is to
      take some steps in that direction. I have recently started to take
          some courses on Udemy, the first one being a Python course. So
          far, I really like web scraping with BeautifulSoup. Looking
          forward to learn about Selenium. Hope to expand my coding
          knowledge with JavaScript and some C or C++ later. I even had a go
      at making music on my computer a few times, but that never amounted up
      to anything. I am also interested in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby">
      <h3 class="hobby-title-left">🎬 Movies</h3>
      <p class="hobby-text">My favourite movies include The Fightclub,
          Snatch, Memento, Project X and Pulp Fiction. I really like most
          works of Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino. My favourite
          series are Stranger Things, Twin Peaks, The Witcher and Bojack
          Horseman.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="hobby">
      <h3 class="hobby-title-right">Animals 🦩</h3>
      <p class="hobby-text">I love animals. I almost always lived in a
          household with some cats around, but love other pets too. I also
          collect flamingo items in any way imaginable. Except for the
          real bird of course, that is off the table.</p>
